# Event Streaming

## Introduction

_ProconTEL Event Streaming_ is a set of events which are exposed via _Event Hub_ service to outside world. For example, if endpoint broadcasts a message or completes its activation an event is published by _ProconTEL Event Hub_ service.

## What you can find here?
This documentation contains information about available events and defines scenarios in which events are published. Description of each event contains definition of event data structure and usage scenario written in BDD approach.
There is also instruction how to consume available events.

## Prerequisites
To use _Event Streaming_: 
1. Install _ProconTEL 3.0.20_ or newer.
2. Configure it according to [How to activate ProconTEL Event Streaming](#how-to-activate).

<div id='how-to-activate'/>

## How to activate and configure ProconTEL Event Streaming
Currently Event Streaming is an experimental feature which is turned off by default.  
To activate it, open your **_Server Configuration Manager_** and set property **_General\Enable statistics monitoring mechanism_** to **_True_**.  
Optionally you can change default address used for _Event Streaming_ by editing _General\Event Hub REST API address_'.  
After that **_ProconTEL Administration_ service must be restarted**.  
Additionally make sure that 'ProconTEL Event Hub' service is running.

## How to consume events

### Basics

To consume events generated by _Event Hub_ you need to implement your own connector. 
**Event hub publishes events via SignalR**, so at first you need to find SignalR client appropriate for your technology, e.g.: 
* [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/dotnet-client)
* [JS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client)
* [Java](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/java-client)

Having SignalR client referenced in your custom application, you need to create _HubConnection_ and pass URL to your _Event Hub_, e.g. _'http://{ip}:{port}/events'_.
As a next step you need to subscribe to needed streams/methods: 
* **_trafficEventReceived_**, if you want to receive [traffic events](#traffic-events-definition);
* **_infrastructureEventReceived_**, if you want to receive [infrastructure events](#infrastructure-events-definition).

## Exposed events

<div id='common-definitions'/>

## Common definitions

List of common definitions which are used when defining events.

### Standard endpoints

ProconTEL comes with pre-installed set of endpoints which are called _Standard Endpoints_. In this document only a subset of all pre-installed endpoints is refered to as _Standard Endpoints_ and these are:
- _Database Telegram Writer_,
- _Telegram Cache_,
- _Mailslot Telegram Handler_,
- _TCP Telegram Handler_,
- _UDP Telegram Handler_.

All comes from one library `ProconTel.CommunicationCenter.StandardEndpoints` and uses legacy content processing methods.

### Endpoint Identity

Allows to uniquely identify ProconTEL endpoint. 

```csharp
public class EndpointIdentity
{
    public string ContainerId { get; set; }
    public string EndpointId { get; set; }
}
```

<div id='traffic-events-definition'/>

## Traffic events definition

Below you can find all available events.

<div id='message-received'/>

### Message received
Event `MessageReceived` is published when message is received by channel.
